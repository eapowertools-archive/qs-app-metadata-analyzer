## About

As of the Qlik Sense June 2018 release, a new application level metadata endpoint is available. Data is populated for this endpoint per app post-reload in a June 2018+ environment. 

You can view this application metadata within your own June 2018+ environment at:
```
http(s)://{server}/api/v1/apps/{GUID}/data/metadata
```

where *{server}* is your Qlik Sense Enterprise server and *{GUID}* is the application ID. Note that the application does not need to be lifted into RAM for the metadata to be accessed.

Data from this endpoint is derived as part of the app reload process, and therefore does not include any object or expression related metadata. The data from the endpoint includes:
- server metadata including number of server cores, total server RAM
- reload time
- app RAM base footprint
- field metadata including cardinality, tags, total count, RAM size
- table metadata including fields, rows, key fields, RAM size

Example output from that endpoint can be seen [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dpi-sse/dpi-qlik-sense-app-metadata-analyzer-server/metadata_example.json).

**_App Metadata Analyzer (Server)_**: This Qlik application iterates over every application metadata endpoint along with several other QRS calls (Nodes, Apps, Proxies, LB audit), ultimately providing a comprehensive dashboard to analyze your application metadata server-wide. This allows you to have a holistic view of the makeup of all of your Qlik applications, enabling you to have awareness at a granular level of the types of applications in your organization. This application is 100% native to Qlik without any installer, and is easy to configure within the Qlik Sense Enterprise environment as the app takes advantage of the existing **'monitor_apps_REST_app'** connection to drive all of the REST calls.

**_App Metadata Analyzer (Single)_**: This Qlik application is designed to target a single metadata endpoint, driven by several variables in the load script that the user can populate manually. This app uses a single REST connection out to the metadata endpoint using the **'monitor_apps_REST_app'** connection, however the REST connection could easily be recreated manually if that is not desired.

**_Hosted App Metadata Analyzer (Single)_**: A hosted version of this application also exists where you can simply paste the JSON response from a single endpoint and generate an app on the fly. This version can be found [here](https://diagnostictoolkit.qlikpoc.com/#applicationMetadataAnalyzer).

## Setup

**_App Metadata Analyzer (Server)_**:
1. Import the qvf into the QMC.
2. Grant **'Read'** access to the **'monitor_apps_REST_app'** data connection in the QMC to the user that will be reloading the application if you plan on reloading the app from the Hub. Ensure that the user can see this connection in the Data Load Editor. Occasionally this takes a services restart to take effect.
3. Ensure that the Qlik Sense service account has **'RootAdmin'** access. The **'monitor_apps_REST_app'** data connection is reloaded by the service account, and that account needs access to specific resources via the QRS API that are not available otherwise.
4. Open up the application and navigate to the Data Load Editor. Navigate to the **Thresholds & Settings** tab, and ensure you have filled out **_vCentralHostname_** with the hostname of your Central Node. There are also many other configurable thresholds (threshold settings, incremental load configuration, etc), but no others that are truly mandatory. To configure incremental loading of the App Metadata endpoints, flip the **_vIncremental_** variable to **1**, and enter a valid **LIB://** path to a folder where you'd like to store your QVDs in the **_vMetadataQVDFolderLocation_**.
5. Reload the application either via a Task in the QMC or as a user other than the service account from the Hub. 
    - _Note that you will always see a successful reload as ErrorMode is set to 0 in the script, meaning that the app will steamroll over errors. This is architected intentionally due to the fact that occasionally app metadata endpoints are not found (receiving 404s), and there is error handling setup in the script to manage this (try three times in that case). If you see a successful reload but do not see data in the application, please check your script logs and ensure that you have properly followed steps 1-4._

**_App Metadata Analyzer (Single)_**:
1. Import the qvf into the QMC.
2. Grant **'Read'** access to the **'monitor_apps_REST_app'** data connection in the QMC to the user that will be reloading the application if you plan on reloading the app from the Hub. Ensure that the user can see this connection in the Data Load Editor. Occasionally this takes a services restart to take effect.
3. Open up the application and navigate to the Data Load Editor. Adjust the variables in the *Settings* script section for your server, application GUID, etc.
4. Reload the application.

## Threshold Settings
Along with the mandatory _vCentralHostname_ variable, there are a number of optional configurable settings in the **Tresholds & Settings** section of the load script of the App Metadata Analyzer (Server) app, as well as in the **Thresholds** section in the App Metadata Analyzer (Single) app. These thresholds are used to create boolean fields in the data model that are then filterable and highlighted throughout the app. Please set these accordingly to your own standards of what your organization wants to maintain for an easier view of outliers. These settings are:
```
//////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Central Node Hostname /////////////////////////
LET vCentralHostname = 'qliksenseserver';       //
//////////////////////////////////////////////////


//////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Thresholds ////////////////////////////////////
//////////////////////////////////////////////////
SET vAppDiskSizeThreshold = 524288000; 			// 500 MB
SET vAppRAMSizeThreshold = 1073751824; 			// 1 GB
SET vRAMToFileSizeRatioThreshold = 6; 			// RAM / File Size is typically between 4-6x
SET vAppRecordCountThreshold = 10000000; 		// Number of records in an app
SET vTableRecordCountThreshold = 10000000; 		// Number of records in a table
SET vFieldValueCountThreshold = 10000000; 		// Number of field records
SET vFieldCardinalityThreshold = 1000000; 		// Number of distinct field values
SET vNoOfFields = 150; 							// Number of Distinct Fields
SET vReloadTimeThreshold = 1800000; 			// 30 Minutes
//////////////////////////////////////////////////


//////////////////////////////////////////////////
// App Last Reloaded Time Interval Match Months //
//////////////////////////////////////////////////
SET vMonthsInInterval = 3;						// How many months apart you want to bucket reload times in for IntervalMatch
//////////////////////////////////////////////////


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Incremental Load Settings ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
SET vIncremental = 0; 																			  // Incremental load flag -- set to 1 to engage
SET vMetadataQVDFolderLocation = 'LIB://Builds (qlik_qservice)/AppMetadataQVDs/'; 				  // where you want your QVD files to be stored (note the trailing slash)
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
```

In the **App Metadata Analyzer (Single)** app, there is an additional **Settings** script section, where you are required to fill in several variables that will ultimately direct the REST connection to the target app. These settings are (including examples):
```
// SET LOCATION
SET vLocation = 'https://qliksenseserver';

// SET APP NAME
SET vAppName = 'Your App Name';

// SET APP GUID
SET vAppGUID = '120d6e16-b913-4e68-b2a0-cb9784d3e886';

// SET APP DISK SIZE IN MB
SET vDiskSize = 425;
```
